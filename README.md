# Skin_cancer_det
The skin cancer detection project using CNN and GAN is an AI-based system that aims to identify and classify skin cancer from images. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic skin cancer images.
